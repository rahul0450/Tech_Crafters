# Problem Statement
## Customized AI Kitchen for India
Our project is an innovative tool designed to help users create personalized recipes based on their
preferences, available ingredients, and cuisine interests. By leveraging 
advanced algorithms and databases of various recipes, our generator can suggest
unique and tailored meal ideas, making cooking more accessible and enjoyable. Whether
you're a novice cook seeking guidance or an experienced chef looking for inspiration, our
recipe generator can streamline meal planning and introduce you to new and exciting 
culinary possibilities.
